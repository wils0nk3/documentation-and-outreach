**Public resources, ethical guidelines, and transparent communications regarding the Rules of Conduct Civil Rights App.**

This repository serves to build community trust, manage public expectations, and provide non-technical information about the app's mission, functionality, and ethical boundaries. It acts as the primary public interface for the private application.

***

## I. 🗣️ User Transparency and Education

This section focuses on lowering the legal barrier for users and clearly defining the app's scope.

* **App Use Case Scenarios:** Non-legal, plain-language examples detailing how the app empowers users to collect evidence for common scenarios (e.g., denial of due process, fraudulent filings, professional indifference).
* **Glossary of Legal Terms:** A simplified lexicon defining key terms (e.g., Color of Law, Deprivation, Overt Act) to increase public understanding of federal civil rights litigation.
* **App Status & Goals:** High-level updates on the project's development status, key milestones achieved, and near-term community goals.

***

## II. 📝 Ethical & Community Guidelines

This section outlines how the community can interact with the project responsibly and ethically.

* **Feedback & Contribution Policy:** Guidelines on how the community can report bugs, suggest features, or provide legal insights **without requiring access to the private source code**.
* **Data Integrity Commitment:** A clear, non-technical commitment to the secure, tamper-proof nature of the evidence collection, directing users to the technical details in the **`security-and-tech-stack`** and **`legal-and-policy`** repositories.
* **Legal Disclaimer:** A strong, visible disclaimer reinforcing that the app provides information and evidence logging tools, **not legal advice** or attorney-client services.

***

## III. ✨ Future Vision

This provides a glimpse into the growth strategy, encouraging long-term sponsor investment.

* **High-Level Roadmap:** A public, non-committal roadmap outlining future goals (e.g., integration with state-specific Rules of Professional Conduct, automated complaint generation templates).
* **Media & Press Kit:** Logos, approved boilerplate text, and contact information for journalists and outreach partners.
